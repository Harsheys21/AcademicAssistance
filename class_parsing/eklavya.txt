The information on this page reflects earned/completed credits as of the effective term listed above.

* If the percentage listed is 25% or less, you are on track to meet the graduation requirement (applies to undergraduates only).
The % Graded Pass is the percentage of passing (P) credits earned excluding any of the following: (1) UCSC courses graded P for quarters in which the Committee on Educational Policy has excluded Pass grades from the percent calculation for graduation (Spring 2020, Summer 2020, Fall 2020, Winter 2021, Spring 2021, Summer 2021, Fall 2022), (2) UCSC courses graded P when a letter grade was requested by the student, and (3) All non-UCSC courses from special programs such as ROTC and domestic exchanges.
UCSC courses include any credits earned in the Education Abroad Program or at another UC campus in an intercampus exchange program. Some majors require all courses in the major to be taken for a letter grade; please visit https://catalog.ucsc.edu for detailed major information.

Double Counting Collapsible section Double Counting 

Double Counting: Beginning fall 2008, UCSC Academic Senate Regulation 10.4.7 allows overlap or double-counting of courses at the upper-division level. However, the Regulation places a limit on the amount of such overlap. For each major a student completes, there must be at least 40 upper-division credits not used to satisfy the minimum upper-division credits of any other major or minor. For each minor there must be at least 25 upper-division credits not used to satisfy the minimum upper-division credits of any other major or minor. For more information about this policy, please refer to the Academic Senate Regulation 10.4.7.
