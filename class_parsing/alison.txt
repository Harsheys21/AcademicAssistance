Important Information Regarding the Academic Advisement Report Collapsible section Important Information Regarding the Academic Advisement Report 
Group Box
The Academic Advisement Report is an unofficial report to help you track your progress toward graduation. Your graduation eligibility is not verified by the AAR alone.

The reportâ€™s results are based on your curriculum history as it currently exists in My UCSC. That history may not always be complete; this is most often the case when the report does not show a student's transfer credit. Please contact your department or college adviser with any questions about your transfer courses and the Academic Advisement Report.

An explanation of Academic Advisement Report contents may be found at

Double Counting: Beginning fall 2008, UCSC Academic Senate Regulation 10.4.7 allows overlap or double-counting of courses at the upper-division level. However, the Regulation places a limit on the amount of such overlap. For each major a student completes, there must be at least 40 upper-division credits not used to satisfy the minimum upper-division credits of any other major or minor. For each minor there must be at least 25 upper-division credits not used to satisfy the minimum upper-division credits of any other major or minor. For more information about this policy, please refer to the Academic Senate Regulation 10.4.7.
